## Using Analyze and predict corona data with redis and machine learning

To use Analyze and predict corona data with redis and machine learning, follow these steps:

```
Start the main.py folder within a Terminal
```
```
C:\src>python main.py arg1 arg2 arg3 arg4

arg1: FutureCast          (Default = 10)
arg2: showAnalyzedData    (Default = True)
arg3: showForecastPlots   (Default = True)
arg4: prophetIncluded     (Default = True)
```
```
You can also change the values in your IDE. Therfore open the main.py file.
Change the parameters shown in the picture below to your liking.
..* FutureCast --> Describes the amount of days forecast methods should predict.
..* showAnalyzedData --> Is True or False and decides, if plots regarding analyzing 
                          corona data should be shown.
..* showForecastPlots --> Is True or False and decides, if plots regarding forecast of 
                          corona data should be shown.
..* prophetIncluded --> Decides if the fbProphet algorithm is executed or not.
